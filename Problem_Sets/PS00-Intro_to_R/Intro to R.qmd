# R as a Calculator

The first thing we will learn is how to use R as a calculator. You can use any of the math operators you want:

- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `^` Exponentiation 

Let's experiment with some arithmetic expressions: 

```{r}
1 + 1
2 / 4
3^2
```


Order of operations (via PEMDAS) apply here too:
```{r}
5 + 2 * 3
```

This does 2 * 3 first and then adds 5 to get 11. 
If we want to do 5 + 2 first, then we can wrap it in parenthesis (the P in PEMDAS):

```{r}
(5 + 2) * 3
``` 

There are even some operators that you might not know that have to do with remainders:
```{r}
# Get the remainder
13 %% 2

# Divide and round down to the nearest decimal
13 %/% 2
```

#### Exercise

Compute the sample average of the following sample of baby weights (in lbs.):

(7.7, 8.2, 8.3, 7.6, 9.2, 7.4, 11.1)

```{r}

```


## R as a functional programming language

R is based around functions. 
A function takes an input (or multiple inputs) and produces an output. 
There are many many functions in R, but first lets learn some calculator type functions. 
For example, if I want to take the square root, I can use the function `sqrt`. 
Here are some example of math functions:

The form of a function call is `function_name(arguments)`

1. The function name, `sqrt`, `abs`, `factorial`
2. Opening parenthesis `(`
3. The argument (in the future arguments)
4. Closing parenthesis `)`

For example `sqrt(16)` says to take the argument `16` and apply the function `sqrt` of it.

#### Exercise

1. Calculate the square root of 147

```{r}

```

2. Try finding the natural log of 10, using `log()`

```{r}

```

3. Practical usage: say the $Var(x) = 12$ and we have a sample size of 55. 
What is the standard deviation of the sample distribution of the sample mean?

```{r}

```

## Giving Things Names (i.e. Creating Variables)

Variables are immensely helpful in R. 
It lets you store values by giving them a `name` and then lets you access the variables later by name. 
I can assign variables using either `<-` or `=`. 

Create variable `x` with value 5 and a variable `y` with value 20.

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 20
```

What is the sum of `x` and `y`?

```{r}
x + y
```

Note the form of creating the variable:

1. The variable name, `x` and `y`
2. Assignment operator `<-` or `=`
3. The value we want to store.

The reason behind the left arrow is that the arrow points to variable name where we want to put the value into.

You can create a variable containing *text* by using `""`

```{r}
instructor_name <- "Kyle Butts"
print(instructor_name)
```

We can use the `cat` command to print out the text to the console:
```{r}
cat(instructor_name)
```


#### Exercise

Use quotation marks to create a string and call it `my_name`.

```{r}
my_name <- "Kyle Butts"
my_name
```


## Glueing together strings

Often time we might want to combine text from multiple sources and/or add data to our strings.
We can use the `paste`/`paste0` functions to combine together strings.
`paste0` will append the strings as written, while `paste` will automatically add a space between each thing it is concatenating. 
Dealer's choice for which you prefer

For example,
```{r}
paste0("Kyle", "Butts")
paste("Kyle", "Butts")
```

What is cool about these functions is they take any number of arguments and append them together. 
For example, we can write a paste function that takes your height in inches and prints a human-readable string.

```{r}
height_in_inches <- 70
paste0(
  "My height is ",
  height_in_inches %/% 12,
  "'",
  height_in_inches %% 12,
  "\""
)
```

Note that numbers get automatically converted to a string.
One subtle point you might have missed. 
If we start and end strings with double quotes, how can we include one in the text itself?
Above, we did this with the escape key `\"`. 
You probably won't need to do this, but it's worth mentioning nevertheless.

#### Exercise

1. Construct a string that reports on the average baby weight in your sample. 
   It would be nice to create a variable that stores `mean_baby_weight` to make the code nicer to read.
   These were the weights: `(7.7, 8.2, 8.3, 7.6, 9.2, 7.4, 11.1)`

```{r}

```

2. Try printing out the following string: `\U1F919`. What is displayed?

```{r}

```

**Answer:**




# Vectors

So far, we have dealth with scalar numbers and texts. 
But, when working with data, we will observe many units and need a way to store all their values together.
This is where the bread and butter of data-science comes in: Vectors.

Vectors are a list of elements like integers, numbers, or strings. 
This is really useful for storing data! 
You use `c` to create a vector (pneumonically, `c` stands for combine).

```{r}
## Rebounds from 2023 NBA Season
# fmt: skip
rebounds <- c(260, 114, 252, 310, 165, 236, 148, 336, 941, 127, 384, 278, 300, 6, 136, 145, 233, 142, 420, 35, 11, 161, 485, 1, 830, 81, 112, 16, 63, 513, 162, 296, 434, 239, 22, 269, 235, 222, 485, 245, 578, 162, 281, 344, 39, 99, 82, 79, 476, 3, 69, 84, 201, 52, 223, 244, 34, 728, 5, 423, 286, 346, 324, 549, 580, 152, 401, 58, 95, 187, 618, 189, 69, 184, 34, 101, 36, 7, 472, 78, 41, 631, 259, 12, 760, 33, 410, 672, 70, 227, 272, 247, 289, 63, 96, 500, 497, 739, 188, 178, 491, 1, 298, 202, 211, 307, 227, 439, 253, 24, 740, 168, 921, 61, 210, 213, 209, 150, 145, 220, 26, 144, 286, 190, 56, 182, 580, 105, 402, 660, 260, 118, 0, 231, 11, 184, 69, 432, 807, 257, 762, 24, 42, 342, 95, 185, 77, 310, 170, 447, 98, 271, 8, 41, 99, 85, 102, 593, 275, 24, 10, 206, 407, 51, 184, 0, 98, 10, 305, 43, 112, 30, 80, 312, 292, 292, 899, 182, 317, 511, 665, 78, 633, 314, 32, 11, 49, 205, 402, 296, 46, 26, 261, 429, 451, 66, 546, 206, 35, 5, 63, 161, 227, 394, 308, 118, 92, 249, 691, 257, 85, 220, 483, 233, 909, 744, 564, 208, 573, 25, 243, 16, 2, 30, 132, 34, 468, 460, 330, 268, 1, 252, 318, 453, 473, 33, 82, 494, 26, 450, 54, 110, 145, 870, 670, 111, 1, 179, 448, 700, 74, 845, 30, 27, 639, 15, 97, 705, 96, 54, 295, 312, 556, 39, 551, 426, 45, 258, 8, 233, 564, 630, 536, 5, 255, 95, 173, 11, 51, 106, 71, 393, 317, 149, 394, 301, 319, 19, 147, 257, 336, 350, 19, 416, 829, 2, 219, 1530, 171, 124, 54, 47, 296, 30, 26, 96, 168, 14, 118, 770, 310, 66, 934, 42, 415, 204, 634, 202, 301, 391, 177, 81, 256, 116, 188, 76, 417, 1, 28, 435, 191, 449, 270, 265, 5, 1, 0, 47, 183, 0, 22, 247, 0, 381, 19, 2, 862, 253, 469, 55, 37, 90, 246, 78, 88, 512, 0, 101, 265, 28, 238, 223, 257, 372, 21, 236, 94, 81, 295, 206, 704, 454, 607, 145, 129, 282, 405, 247, 1258, 15, 269, 9, 240, 260, 305, 75)
```

It is kind of a pain in the neck to write all these out; and worse, prone to errors!
Later, we will learn how to load data from a file, making this much easier. 

You can access elements of a vector by using `[#]`, where `#` is the $i$-th element you want

```{r}
rebounds[1]
rebounds[2]
```

If you want to access more than one element, we can subset using *a vector!* (how meta):

```{r}
rebounds[c(1, 2)]
```

One special syntax is ther `a:b` which generates $a, a+1, \dots, b$.
This makes it easy to grab the first 5 values:
```{r}
rebounds[1:5]
```

Standard math operators work on vectors element by element:

```{r}
rebounds[1:5] + 1
rebounds[1:5] / 12 # dozens of rebounds
```

If we want to know how many elements are in a vector, we can use the `length` function:
```{r}
length(rebounds)
```


## Summarizing vectors

The natural next step is to start trying to summarize the data. 
There are a set of built-in functions that provide statistical summaries of the data.

```{r}
## Mean, standard deviation, and variance
mean(rebounds)
sd(rebounds)
var(rebounds)

## Extremes
max(rebounds)
min(rebounds)

## chaining functions
sqrt(var(rebounds))
```

Some functions will take extra **arguments** that give more instructions.
For example, the `quantile` function returns information about percentiles of the distribution. 
You can add extra arguments, separated by commas.
For example, `quantile`'s first argument is a vector and the second argument is what percentiles you want to find.  

```{r}
## Percentiles of the data
quantile(rebounds, c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9))
```

We will talk in more details about plotting below, but for now we can use the `hist()` function to give us a view of the distribution of the vector

```{r}
hist(rebounds)
```

### Help menu

How did I know the order of arguments for `quantile`? 
Are there ways to customize the histogram created by `hist`?
In general, if you have a question about a function, then you need to address that function's **documentation**.
To do so, click in to your console and type `?func_name` where `func_name` is the name of the function, e.g. `quantile`.
At first, the information may be very overwhelming.
The documentation in base R functions are very detailed, but are not great at introducing the functions.
You should focus on the **Arguments** section and perhaps the **Examples** section, in my opinion. 
In particular, the order of the arguments is probably helpful in order of importance


#### Exercise

Similar to `c`, the `seq` function creates a vector: a **seq**uence of 
numbers. 

1. Create a sequence of all multiples of four from 4 to 100. Look at ``?seq` for help.
   Hint: The arguments you need here are `from`, `to`, and `by`.
   Store your vector in a varaible

2. Find the 19th element of this sequence

3. What is the sum of the 10th and 11th element of this sequence.


### `NA`s 

In the real world, some times we will not have a value for a variable for an individual (e.g. people don't fill answer a survey question).
In `R`, this is represented as an `NA`.

```{r}
reviews <- c(5, NA, 4, 4, 3, 5, NA, 4, 5, 2)
```

What is the average (mean and median) review?
```{r}
mean(reviews)
median(reviews)
```

By default, the statistical summary functions will all produce `NA` when they are present in the data.
`R` wants you to *opt-in* to ignoring the missings. 
To do this, functions will take an extra **argument** called `na.rm`:

```{r}
mean(reviews, na.rm = FALSE)
max(reviews, na.rm = FALSE)
```

A lot of this information will be presented to you by the `summary` function.
For numberic vectors, `summary` produces the five-number summary, the mean, and the number of `NA`s (if any)

```{r}
summary(reviews)
```

### Logical Vectors

So far, we have seen two kinds of vectors: numeric and character vectors.
A third, common, vector is a **logical** vector:
```{r}
ordered_takeout <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
```

Logical vectors can take only two values: `TRUE` and `FALSE`. 
They can be treated as numbers by using `as.numeric()` with `TRUE` becoming `1` and `FALSE` becoming `0`.
```{r}
as.numeric(ordered_takeout)
```

One common trick is to use `sum()` on a logical vector and it will return the number of `TRUE`s:
```{r}
sum(ordered_takeout)
```

Logical vectors are often returned by other operations.
For example, we can check whether elements of a vector equal some value with `==`.
Other operators that produce a logical vector include `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`.

```{r}
## Find five-star reviews
reviews == 5

## Find three-star or lower
reviews <= 3
```

Logical vectors can be **negated** using the `!` operator:

```{r}
## Find non five-star reviews
!(reviews == 5)
```

You can also use the following operators to supply multiple criteria:

- `&` And operator. Both vector 1 **and** vector 2 must be true for the observation
- `|` Or operator. **Either** vector 1 **or** vector 2 must be true for the observation

```{r}
(reviews == 5) & (reviews == 4)
```

```{r}
(reviews == 5) | (reviews == 4)

## Equivalent to
reviews >= 4
```


### Subsetting of vectors by logical

We have already discussed one way of subsetting vectors via a vector of integers.
This is called "subsetting by index".

The other common way is by using a logical vector the same length of the vector you wish to subset.
For example, let's look at the reviews for takeout orders and dine-in orders separately

```{r}
## Takeout orders
reviews[ordered_takeout]

## Dine-in orders
reviews[!ordered_takeout]
```

#### Exercise

1. What is the average review for take-out orders?

```{r}

```

2. The `is.na()` function takes a vector as an argument and returns a logical vector that equals `TRUE` if the element is `NA`. 
   Using this and the `!`, subset the reviews to only non-`NA` values. 
   What is the average review? Comapre this to `mean(reviews, na.rm = TRUE)`.

```{r}
mean(reviews[!is.na(reviews)])
mean(reviews, na.rm = TRUE)
```



### Vectorized operations

Often times we want to use multiple vectors for some calculation.
Like single numbers, arithmetic can be done element-by-element with vectors.
This means +, -, *, / and ^ all work on a vector.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(5, 5, 5)

x + y
x^2
```

There are two main features to remember:
1. The vectors you use should be of the same length (if they are not, some weird *recycling* rules occur that we will not discuss in this introduction). 
2. Scalars are treated as a vector of the same length with that single number repeated for each element.

```{r}
## Equivalent:
x + 2
x + rep(2, 3)
```

More, many functions are designed to be used on vectors element by element.
All of the functions we used in the "Calculator" section do this:
```{r}
exp(x)
log(x)
sqrt(x^2)
```

#### Exercise

1. Try to guess the output of the following expression `2*x + y + 1`.


### Sorting data

The final vector operation we will discuss is how to sort data; either ascending or descending in value.
There are two ways to do this. 

First, we can use the `sort()` function.
The function takes a function and an optional `decreasing` argument.
`decreasing` takes a logical `TRUE`/`FALSE` option. 
By default, it increases in values
```{r}
sort(rebounds, decreasing = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, we can use the `order()` function to get the *row indices* of the ordering:
```{r}
order(rebounds, decreasing = TRUE)
```

The first element of the resulting vector is the index of the maximum number (1530)
```{r}
order(rebounds, decreasing = TRUE)[1]
which.max(rebounds)
```

What this means is that we can use the result of `order` to subset the vector to get the sorted vector:
```{r}
rebounds[order(rebounds, decreasing = TRUE)]
```

This might seem like a bit silly, but it will prove useful when we want to sort multiple vectors at the *same time* based on one of the vectors. 


#### Exercise


1. Create a vector with the following 20 observations and call it `height`:

64, 65, 64, 66, 67, 64, 67, 66, 66, 67, 70, 66, 70, 68, 68, 67, 69, 67, 67, 69

a. Use `length` and confirm there are twenty observations

b. Subset the first 4 elements of the `height`

c. Subset the last two elements of `height`

d. Compute the five-number summary, the mean, and the sd of `height`. 

e. Print out the heights in order from tallest to shortest

```{r}

```


# Dataframes (or, a group of vectors)

Dataframes are a special object in R. 
A dataframe is simply a collection of **vectors** and looks like a typical excel spreadsheet.
The columns of a dataframe are each **vectors** that contain variables and a row contains an **observation**.
This is the coding equivalent of an excel spreadsheet. 
If you are using Positron, clicking the dataframe in the `Variables` tab or typing `View(df_name)` into the console will let you interactively scroll though the data. 

First, we will load some data.frames that come with a **package** in R.
We can do that using the `data` function.
Let's load the `penguins` data set which contain a census conducted on multiple species of penguins on a set of islands:
![Three species of penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/raw/main/man/figures/lter_penguins.png)

```{r}
data(penguins, package = "palmerpenguins")
```

We can use the `head()` function to view the first few rows. 
It prints out the first 6 rows of the dataset so you can see the variables. 
BTW, this function works on vectors too!

```{r}
head(penguins)
```

Another helpful function is `str()` which prints a similar format, but is a little easier to read, especially when there are a lot of variables in the dataset. 

```{r}
str(penguins)
```

The output of string shows that a data.frame is just a list of vectors that have names (`species`, `island`, ...). 

Finally, you can access the number of rows and number of columns with `nrow`/`ncol`

```{r}
print(paste0(nrow(penguins), " obs. of ", ncol(penguins), " variables"))
```

#### Exercise

1. What constitutes a row in the penguins dataframe? What constitutes a column?


## Accessing vectors by name with `$`

The first thing we might want to do is access some of the vectors from the `penguins` dataframe. 
If you type `species` into the console and hit enter, you will see this error: `Error: object 'species' not found`. 
Get used to recognizing this error becuase you will probably accidentally make this mistake a lot at first.

This errors occurs because R does not know that you mean "look for `species` in the `penguins` dataset".
To access an individual vector, we must specify *both* the dataframe and the vector's name. 
To do this, we use the `$` operator like this: `penguins$species`. 
This looks into the dataframe stored in the `penguins` variable and looks for the vector named `species`:
```{r}
penguins$species
```

When using Positron, after you type the `$` a little pop-up menu wil show up that shows you all the available variable names.
You can use the arrow keys to find the variable and hit enter (or tab) to have it type the variable name for you.

Try that below to find the avariable measuring the depth of a penguin's bill:
```{r}

```


## General subsetting with `[,]` 

Now, let's think about subsetting the dataframe to a specific set of rows. 
Given that we used `[idx]` for vectors (either a logical vector or integer index), you might think we can do the same with data.frames.
This is good intuition, but remember a data frame has both rows and columns!
We will still use `[,]` to subset, but we need a `,` to specify rows and columns.

The syntax therefore is `df[ROWS, COLUMNS]`. 
Before comma = rows and After comma = columns.
If either `ROWS` or `COLUMNS` is left blank, then it will assume you want all rows or all colums respectively.

Let me show you some examples:

```{r}
## First 5 rows, all columns
penguins[1:5, ]
```

```{r}
## All rows, the species column
penguins[, "species"]
```

```{r}
## First 5 rows, the species column
penguins[1:5, "species"]
```

```{r}
## First 10 rows, the species and island columns
penguins[1:10, c("species", "island")]
```


You can "chain" together calls and between `[,]` and `$` syntaxes.
For example let's say I want the variable `island` for the first 6 observations:
```{r}
penguins[1:6, "island"]
penguins[1:6, ]$island
```

But, if I do `penguins$island`, this results in a vector. 
So, to get the first 6 elements, I use only `[]` without a comma:
```{r}
penguins$island[1:6]
```

#### Exercise

1. Use the `unique()` function to find the unique values of the variable `species` in the penguins dataset.

```{r}

```

2. Use the `table()` function to find how many penguins there are of each species.

```{r}

```

3. Imagine we use `penguins[1:5]` to try and grab the first 5 rows. What happens?

```{r}

```



## Selecting rows based on criteria

Lets see which penguins live on Torgersen.

We can use the `==` operator to compare a vector to a value (or set of values). 
For example, here we see if each penguin's island is `"Torgersen"`. 
It produces a `boolean` vector of TRUEs and FALSEs

```{r}
on_torgersen <- penguins$island == "Torgersen"
on_torgersen
```

We can subset the data using a boolen vector.
We pass this boolean vector to the `ROWS` section of `[,]`

```{r}
penguins[penguins$island == "Torgersen", ]
penguins[penguins$island == "Torgersen", ]$body_mass_g
```

You can also use the following operators to supply multiple criteria:
- `&` And operator. Both vector 1 **and** vector 2 must be true for the observation
- `|` Or operator. **Either** vector 1 **or** vector 2 must be true for the observation

```{r}
penguins$island == "Torgersen" & penguins$sex == "male"
penguins$island == "Torgersen" | penguins$sex == "male"
```


#### Exercise

1. Subset the `penguins` dataframe to male penguins that weigh over 3500 grams

```{r}

```


2. Are all three species present on the Torgersen island? The `table` or `unique` functions might be helpful here.

```{r}

```

3. Which species has the heaviest penguin? 

```{r}

```

4. 



#### Exercise

![Penguin Beak Measurements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/man/figures/culmen_depth.png)

Lets compare Bill Length between the three species of penguins in our dataset: the Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins.

Using `[]` and `<-`, create 3 dataframes called `penguins_ad`, `penguins_gent`, and `penguins_chin` that subset based on the correct species of penguins.

"Adelie", "Gentoo", "Chinstrap"

```{r}

```


What is the mean of each species bill length in millimeters? (remember there are NAs so we will need to use `na.rm = TRUE`).

```{r}

```


## Creating new variables

We can create *new* variables in our dataset by using the `$` or `[]` operators with `<-`.

```{r}
penguins$body_mass_g

# 0.0022 lbs = 1 g
penguins$body_mass_lb <- 0.00220462 * penguins$body_mass_g
```


### Exericse

Your R exercise asks you to calculate the standard deviation without using the `var()` or `sd()` command. We want to remove `NA`s manually to fix this. A helpful command is `is.na()`. Let's practice computing the variance of body_mass_lb by hand. You will want to use `nrow()`

```{r}

```


## Loading data into R

In R, you can either load data from a website or from a computer. 
Usually data is found in a .csv file, but sometimes it will be in different forms that R can read.

```{r}
# From a website
fandango <- read.csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylebutts/UARK_4753/refs/heads/main/R_Labs/Lab_02/data/fandango_score_comparison.csv"
)
head(fandango)
```

However, most common is to download the data and put it in the folder where your `.Rmd` file is. 
To load data you will need to find the file location. 
By default, the working directory is whereever the `.qmd` file is located. So if your dataset is in the same folder as `.qmd`, you can load it by name:
```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
penguins <- read.csv("data/penguins.csv")
```

Or, say you have your data in a subfolder called `data`.
Then, you would use `penguins <- read.csv("data/penguins.csv")`.

If you have a dataframe that you want to export to a csv function, you will use the function `write.csv(df, "path/to/file.csv")`. 
This uses the same working directory as `read.csv` and relative paths to the file work the same way.  



## Sorting dataframes

There are two different ways to sort the rows of a data.frame.

First, we can use the `order` method we used on vectors: `df[order(...), ]`.

```{r}
penguins[order(penguins$body_mass_g), ]
```

Or, we can use special function `sort_by`.
This takes two arguments: 1. the `data.frame` and 2. the vector you want to sort by: 

```{r}
sort_by(penguins, penguins$body_mass_g)
```

Alternatively, we can pass a one-sided **formula** that gives the variables you want to sort by.
A **formula** is a commonly used tool in R that lets you write variable name(s) without needing to specify the `data.frame` they come from.  
A one-sided formula is written as `~ xvar` (the tilde is next to the number 1 on your keyboard). 

```{r}
sort_by(penguins, ~body_mass_g)
```

Say we want to first sort by species (so that each species is a contiguous chunk of rows) and then within species, sort by body mass. 
To do so, we can use multiple variables separated by a `+` in the formula syntax.

```{r}
sort_by(penguins, ~ species + body_mass_g)
```



# Plotting

## Histograms

Common functions for graphing are `hist()` for plotting one variable and `plot()` for plotting two variables. 

```{r}
# Count
hist(penguins$body_mass_lb)
```

You can add additional commands for better plots. Use `?hist` to see the list of options. 

#### Exercise

1. Type `?hist` into the console and find the following options:

- Find the option that will give you probabilities (instead of counts)
- the bar color
- the x-axis label
- the main title

Change these to make a more professional histogram:
```{r}
## Modify this
hist(penguins$body_mass_lb)
```


2. Compare this distributions of `bill_length_mm` for Adelie and Chinstrap penguins. 

```{r}

```


## Scatter Plots

While we haven't talked about this yet, it is typically of interest to compare multiple variables together. 
To plot two variables, we will use the `plot()` function to make scatter plots.

```{r}
plot(
  penguins$flipper_length_mm,
  penguins$body_mass_lb,
  main = "Scatter plot of flipper length and body mass"
)
```

It can be kind of annoying to type `penguins$` twice in plot.
There is a second way to call `plot` which uses **formula** syntax.
A formula has the following syntax `yvar ~ xvar` where `yvar` and `xvar` are variable names.
So we can use `body_mass_lb ~ flipper_length_mm` to specify variables and then tell `plot` to use the `penguins` data.frame using the `data` argument.
```{r}
plot(
  body_mass_lb ~ flipper_length_mm,
  data = penguins,
  main = "Scatter plot of flipper length and body mass"
)
```

If the `data` argument is not provided, it will look for `body_mass_lb` and `flipper_length_mm` as variables defined in the **global environment**. 
If these variables are within a data.frame and not as their own variables, then you will get the "object not found" error again.

The reason I am showing you this is that this syntax will show up again when we run linear regressions in this class.
And, in fact, this form of function calling where we use a `data` argument and then reference variables *within* that data.frame by name is actually quite common (see `dplyr` section in advanced materials).




## (optional) ggplot2

There is a package called `ggplot2` that improves base Rs graphing library. 
We will not cover the details here, but a curious student can find much more details here: https://ggplot2-book.org/

This is a particularly nice introduction: https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/post/06-ggplot2/

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(
    data = penguins,
    aes(x = body_mass_lb, color = species, fill = species),
    alpha = 0.3
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Histogram of Penguin Body Mass, by species",
    x = "Weight (in lb.)",
    color = "Species",
    fill = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_grey() +
  scale_fill_grey() +
  theme_gray()
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = penguins,
    aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_lb, color = species)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of Penguin Data, by species",
    x = "Flipper Length (in mm)",
    y = "Weight (in lb.)",
    color = "Species",
    fill = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_grey() +
  theme_gray()
```

`ggplot2` makes it really easy to make beautiful and professional graphs and it would be a **really** useful skill to have in your career

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  aes(
    x = bill_length_mm,
    y = bill_depth_mm,
    group = species
  )
) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = species, shape = species),
    size = 3,
    alpha = 0.8
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(color = species)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange", "purple", "cyan4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Penguin bill dimensions",
    subtitle = "Bill length and depth for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Bill length (mm)",
    y = "Bill depth (mm)",
    color = "Penguin species",
    shape = "Penguin species"
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "inside",
    legend.position.inside = c(0.85, 0.15),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic"),
    plot.caption.position = "plot"
  )
```
