# Install R and RStudio

The first part of the assignment is aimed at getting your computers set up for the rest of the course. You need to download two different softwares. 

1. \href{https://cloud.r-project.org/}{\texttt{R}} is the statistical software that we will use for this course.

2. [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is a visual code editor that makes editing and running code way easier.


You will know that you have installed R and RStudio correctly if when you start RStudio, you see a message in the Console tab that says `R 4.4.1 started':

```{r R-startup, echo = F, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("R-startup.png")
```


Good job! Now, we have to install two packages.
Copy the following lines into the console and hit `Enter`.
This will take a minute or two, but once you have done this you will be ready for the semester.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("fixest")
install.packages("fpp3")
install.packages("patchwork")
# This will install LaTeX on your system (for compiling qmd to pdf)
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

It should look like this when you are finished:

```{r R-installed, echo = F, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("R-installed.png")
```


# Quarto documents

On the course website, you can download `ex_doc.qmd`. If you have everything set up correctly, you should be able to knit this code into a pdf document.

Once it runs, you can view the output. A very nice and professional looking document (this is great for making reports at a business). 

You might feel lost looking at this document, so the first thing you should do is read through some resources to familiarize yourself with Markdown and RMarkdown. To begin, complete the following tasks:

1. Read this guide on [Using Markdown](https://datavizf24.classes.andrewheiss.com/resource/markdown.html)

2. Read this guide on [Using Quarto](https://datavizf24.classes.andrewheiss.com/resource/quarto.html)

3. If this is your first time using R, please read through "Lab 2.3" of the Introduction to Statistical Learning in R book. It is a nice introduction to the basics of R needed for this course.
